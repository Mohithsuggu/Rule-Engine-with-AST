# Rule Engine with Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

This project implements a simple rule engine that evaluates user eligibility based on specified attributes such as age, department, income, and experience. It utilizes an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent and manipulate conditional rules efficiently.

## Features

- **Enhanced AST Structure**: Supports efficient modifications and evaluations of rules.
- **Efficient Rule Parsing**: Parses rule strings and constructs ASTs while respecting operator precedence.
- **Optimized Rule Combination**: Combines multiple rules into a single AST, minimizing redundancy.
- **Efficient Rule Evaluation**: Evaluates rules against user data.
- **Error Handling and Validation**: Ensures rules and data formats are valid.

## Data Structure

The core data structure is a `Node` that represents either an operator or an operand in the AST.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, node_type, left=None, right=None, value=None):
        self.type = node_type  # "operator" or "operand"
        self.left = left  # Reference to left child
        self.right = right  # Reference to right child
        self.value = value  # Value for operand nodes
```

## Installation

To use this project, simply clone the repository and install any necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone <[repository-url](https://github.com/Mohithsuggu/Rule-Engine-with-AST)>
cd <Rule-Engine-with-AST>
# No specific dependencies for this example
```

## Usage

You can use the rule engine by defining your rules and user data as shown in the example below:

```python
def main():
    # Sample rules
    rules = [
        "((age > 30 AND department = 'Sales') OR (age < 25 AND department = 'Marketing')) AND (salary > 50000 OR experience > 5)",
        "((age > 30 AND department = 'Marketing')) AND (salary > 20000 OR experience > 5)"
    ]
    
    # Validate and combine rules
    combined_rule = combine_rules(rules)
    
    # Sample user data
    user_data = {
        "age": 35,
        "department": "Sales",
        "salary": 60000,
        "experience": 3
    }

    # Evaluate combined rule
    is_eligible = evaluate_rule(combined_rule, user_data)
    print("User is eligible:", is_eligible)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Functions Overview

### 1. Enhanced AST Structure

- **`Node` Class**: Represents nodes in the AST.

### 2. Efficient Rule Parsing

- **`create_rule(rule_string)`**: Parses a rule string and constructs the corresponding AST.

### 3. Optimized Rule Combination

- **`combine_rules(rules)`**: Combines multiple rules into a single AST.

### 4. Efficient Rule Evaluation

- **`evaluate_rule(ast, data)`**: Evaluates the AST against the provided data.

### 5. Error Handling and Validation

- **`validate_rule(rule_string)`**: Validates the rule string format.
- **`validate_data(data, expected_attributes)`**: Ensures all required attributes are present in the data.

## Testing

You can test the functionality by running the `main()` function, which demonstrates how to create rules, combine them, and evaluate eligibility based on sample user data.
